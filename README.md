# User Management Interface Specification

## Introduction
This document outlines the user interface specifications for the User Management Screen. The specifications detail the UI components, behaviors, and user interactions required to manage user accounts within the system.

## UI Components
- **New User Button**: Button to initiate the creation of a new user.
- **Hide Disabled User Toggle**: A switch to show/hide disabled user accounts.
- **User List Table**: Displays a list of users with columns for ID, Username, Email, and Enabled status.
- **User Details Form**: A form to add or edit user details like Username, Display Name, Phone, Email, User Roles, and Enabled status.

## Page Behavior
- **On Load**: The page displays a list of active users by default.
- **New User Button Click**: Clears the User Details Form for new user entry.
- **Hide Disabled User Toggle**: Filters the User List Table to exclude disabled users when toggled on.

## User Interactions
- **User Selection**: Clicking on a user in the User List Table populates the User Details Form with their data for editing.
- **Save User**: Submits the form data to create a new user or update existing user information.

## Development Notes
- Ensure all form inputs have appropriate validations before submission.
- Implement confirmation prompts for destructive actions (e.g., disabling a user).
- Use responsive design principles to ensure usability across devices.
